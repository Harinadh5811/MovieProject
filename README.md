# MovieProject

Welcome to the Movie Playlist Application! This project is built using Spring Boot and allows users to search for movies, create personalized lists of movies, and manage these lists with user authentication. Users can sign up, sign in, search for movies using the OMDB API, and create either public or private movie lists.

## Features

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Sign In
   - Sign Up

2. **Movie Search**:
   - Search movies using the OMDB API
   - View detailed information about movies

3. **Movie Lists**:
   - Create lists of movies (similar to YouTube playlists)
   - Display different movie lists created by the user on the home page
   - Option to make lists public (accessible by anyone with the link) or private (only visible to the creator)

4. **Responsive Layout**:
   - User-friendly and visually appealing interface for search and list pages
